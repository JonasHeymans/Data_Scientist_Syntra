# Learning Outcomes – Pandas Student Notebook Series

This document describes the learning outcomes for the complete series of Pandas student notebooks. The notebooks are designed as a progressive curriculum that builds **analytical thinking**, not just technical Pandas fluency. Each notebook targets a specific class of analytical mistakes and gradually develops professional data analysis habits.

## Easy Foundations — Students Performance (Easy)

Students learn to confidently work with a single clean table. They understand what a row represents, how to inspect a dataset, and how to perform basic selections, filtering, feature creation, and grouping. The focus is on correctness, vectorized operations, and building confidence with tabular data.

## Foundations (Easy+) — Students Performance

Students move beyond mechanics into structured reasoning. They begin reasoning about rates instead of raw counts and understand why cleaning matters before grouping.

---

## Titanic — Single-table Foundations

Students work with a moderately messy real-world dataset. They learn to reason about missingness, categorical versus numeric features, and subgroup analysis. The emphasis is on validating results and understanding that code executing successfully does not imply analytical correctness.

---

## House Prices — Feature Engineering & Normalization

Students learn to construct meaningful numerical features and understand why normalization matters. They stop relying on raw magnitudes and begin using ratios and engineered features. The notebook develops intuition around feature usefulness, interpretability, and comparability.

---

## NYC Taxi — Event Data, Time & Rolling Logic

Students learn to work with event-level time data. They understand time direction, leakage, rolling windows, and physical plausibility checks. They practice robust outlier detection and learn that averages must respect causality and temporal order.

---

## Olist — Relational Data, Grain & Joins

Students develop proper relational thinking. They learn to identify grain, aggregate before joining, avoid row explosion, and apply window logic correctly. They clearly distinguish data quality rules from business logic and build defensible metrics across multiple tables.

---

## Instacart — Basket Analysis & Normalization

Students analyze transaction and basket data. They learn why raw counts exaggerate popularity, how to normalize behavior, and how to work with multi-valued fields. They develop resistance to misleading frequency-based conclusions and learn to reason about relative importance.

---

## Netflix — Categorical Cleaning & Catalog Reasoning

Students learn to clean messy categorical data and analyze catalog datasets correctly. They understand the difference between catalog size and activity, and why proportions are more informative than counts. They also learn to identify what a dataset cannot tell them.
